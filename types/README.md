# m3api types

These TypeScript declaration files are compiled from the JSDoc comments in the JavaScript source files.
They are offered in the hope that some will find them useful,
but they should not be considered an integral part of m3api.
(They are also not a part of its stable or even internal interface.)

Suggestions to improve the types are welcome,
provided that the improvements can be implemented in the JS files
without negatively impacting the JS code too much.
(For instance, the way the files are currently distributed could perhaps be improved.)
